In this project, you’ll get hands-on with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. You’ll learn how to build a serverless function that retrieves data from a DynamoDB table—an essential skill for modern, scalable applications.

This project is especially relevant for roles like Backend Developer, Cloud Engineer, or Cloud Architect, where creating scalable, efficient cloud solutions is a core responsibility.

In this project, you’ll:

- Create a DynamoDB table to store user data
- Build a serverless Lambda function to retrieve data
- Write tests to validate your function’s ability to fetch from DynamoDB
- Configure secure permissions for your Lambda function
- Protect your database using an inline policy

Three-Tier Architecture

This is the third project in our three-tier architecture series. You can complete it on its own, or as part of the full series.

Three-tier architecture organizes applications into three essential layers: presentation, logic, and data.

In this project, you’ll focus on the data tier—the layer responsible for storing, managing, and securing the information your application relies on.
